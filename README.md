Made by [Leonardo Fralini](https://github.com/Fralo), [Mattia Marilli](https://github.com/mattiamarilli) and [Edoardo Viviani](https://github.com/vivedo)

### Dependencies
 - cmake v3.2
 - libsfml v2.5
 - Catch2 _(submodule)_
 - tinyxml2 _(submodule)_

### Build
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Fralo/Stealth.git --recursive
$ mkdir Stealth/build && cd Stealth/build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

### Maps
Maps are built using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), an open source tiled map editor, and exported in [TMX](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/) (Tiled Map XML) format.
Stealth loads all tiled maps resources from *res/maps* directory.

Tilesets must be included in the TMX file, and the map must contain the following objects:
 - A *Layer Group* named `background`
 - An *Object Group* named `objects`

All *Tile Layers* inside `background` are immutable and will be drawn on the background following their order.

*Objects* must use tiles that have these 2 collision objects defined:
 - A *Rectangle* with type `cbox`, which will represent the object collison box
 - A *Point* with type `cx`, which will store the y plane the object will be drawn
 
Objects can have properties specified in the 'custom property' tab of the TMX editor (tileset properties are ignored):

| property name | default value | accepted values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `destroyable` | *false* | *true*, *false* |
| `explosive` | *false* | *true*, *false* |
